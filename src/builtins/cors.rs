/*
  Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS)
  An HTTP-header based mechanism that allows a server to indicate any origins (domain, scheme, or port) other than its own from which a browser should permit loading resources.

  Visit: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/CORS

  In Plain English:
  Let's say, this server is for `foo.com`
  The following `allowed_origin()` indicate that only
  The listed FQDN are allowed to make `JavaScript API` calls
  Such as `XHR` or `fetch()` request to the `foo.com`
  Otherwise, leave it as it is
